**Project Description: Resume Screening Application**

The Resume Screening Application is a practical project designed to showcase the integration of natural language processing techniques in human resources. This project focuses on creating a Python-based application that automates the initial screening process of resumes for job applications. The project utilizes libraries such as `docx2txt`, `scikit-learn`, and `tkinter` for processing Word documents, implementing text analysis, and building a user interface.

**Key Features:**
1. **Resume Loading:** Users can browse and load resume files in Word document format (.docx) into the application.
2. **Text Analysis:** The application extracts and analyzes the text from the loaded resume and a default job description.
3. **Cosine Similarity:** Utilizes cosine similarity to measure the match percentage between the resume and the job description.
4. **Dynamic Accuracy:** Calculates dynamic accuracy to provide a comprehensive understanding of the matching results.
5. **User-Friendly Interface:** Incorporates a Tkinter-based user interface for an intuitive and interactive user experience.
6. **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling to guide users in case of unexpected issues.

**How to Use:**
1. **Install Libraries:** Ensure the required libraries (`python-docx`, `scikit-learn`, `tk`) are installed using the provided step-by-step guide.
2. **Run the Application:** Execute the Python script to launch the application.
3. **Browse Resume:** Use the "Browse Resume" button to select a resume file.
4. **Modify Job Description:** Optionally modify the job description within the application.
5. **View Results:** Analyze the match percentage, category, and dynamic accuracy in both the console and Tkinter window.
6. **Error Handling:** The application provides error messages for guidance in case of unexpected issues.

This project not only demonstrates technical skills in Python programming and natural language processing but also addresses practical scenarios in HR processes, showcasing the potential for automation in recruitment.

IMPORTANT

- You Must Download all the files from the zip file. Create a Folder in Jupyter Notebook and save all the downloaded files to run the prototype.

The files are:

1. resume screening.ipynb

2. job-description.docx

3. Resume 1.docx

4. Resume 2.docx

5. Resume 3.docx



HOW TO RUN THE CODE

-UNDER THE HEADING PROTOTYPE, IT WILL BE MENTIONED TO RUN THIS CODE BELOW, PLEASE SELECT THE RELEVANT CELL AND CLICK RUN.

-ONCE YOU'VE RUN THE CODE, A POPUP MESSAGE BOX WILL APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN.

-UPLOAD THE DOWNLOADED RESUMES ONE BY ONE TO GET THE OUTPUT (RESUME 1, RESUME 2, RESUME 3).

-YOU WILL SEE THE MATCHED PERCENTAGE OF THE RESUME VS THE JOB DESCRIPTION ON THE POPUP MESSAGE BOX AND THE EXTRACTED RESUME TEXT IN THE OUTPUT CELL.
